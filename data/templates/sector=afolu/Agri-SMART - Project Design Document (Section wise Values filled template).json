      "Practice1": "Residue management",

This organic matter creates favorable microclimatic conditions that optimize decomposition and mineralization of organic matter (“surface composting”) and protect soil from erosion.",
      "Practice2": "Cover crops",
      "Description2": "Cover crops are planted on bare or short-term fallow farmland (e.g. immediately after harvest of crops) to reduce erosion, excessive moisture loss and mineralization of organic matter.",
      "Practice3": "Consociation",
      "Description3": "Consociation of crops to limit soil erosion and reducing damage caused by animals and insects. Those techniques are based on a crop/intercropping model that compensates and completes the differences of each culture increasing soil fertility and limiting the prolonged use of the cultivated soil.",
      "Practice4": "Integrated pest management",
      "Description4": "Formations on integrated pest management will be done (e.g. on controlling the effect of “lagarta do funil do milho”- Spodoptera frugiperda on corn cultivation. The formation will be based on techniques that include the use of biopesticides, mechanical control and the use of specific cultivation techniques (for example, the creation of plants corridors that function as a pest repellent/attractant “push and pull technique”).",
      "Practice5": "Improved seeds",
      "Description5": "Farmers will benefit from improved seed with a high germination power and a high nutritional rate, characterized by a shorter cycle (90 days), compared to those of traditional seeds used in the 4 beneficiary districts (120 days)."

He works closely with Carbonsink in order to follow VERRA's guidelines and requirements. He takes care of the part concerning the SOP, training for field measurements and verifies the data collected both in the first phase (each end of the monitoring day) and in the last (before sending the measurement data to Carbonsink). The field Program Assistant is also responsible joint with the Country Representative of the relationship with the funding donor; - the Rural Development Officer precision is the supervisor of the technicians during the field measurement activities, he also continuously reports with the Field Program Assistant to evaluate the progress of the monitoring activities, difficulties and anomalies found during the measurements. Rural Development Officer works closely with Carbonsink in defining the plot centers and then takes care of support the field technician during the data collection.

COSV technical staff will verifies/ cross-checks data, and assists farmers to fill the questionnaire/SALM pledge forms. At the same time farmers will be assisted in gaining capacity to collect and register parameters such as crop areas and yield. Considering the cropping season, data will be collected by COSV technical staff on paper and then transferred and store on a central database.

This plan covers procedures as described below for: 1. Collecting reliable field measurements and verifying methods used to collect field data; 2. Verifying data entry and analysis techniques; and 3.
