1. Project Details


{
  "projectDetails": {
    "summaryDescription": "Forestal Apepu S.A. is a company established in 2019 by an international forestry fund to conduct sustainable reforestation in Eastern Paraguay. The aim of the company is the sequestration of carbon and the production of quality timber in a highly deforested landscape.",
    "sectoralScopeAndProjectType": "The project activities fall under the eligible AFOLU project category of 'Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR)'. The proposed project is a grouped project.",
    "projectEligibility": {
      "deforestationOfNativeEcosystems": "The project area consisted of agricultural fields, mostly mechanized soy, or implanted pasture, before tree planting took place. A historical forest cover analysis of the area shows that the last conversion of natural forests in the property took place in 2009, 10 years before project start. Conversion was conducted by the former owners (Figure 2 and Figure 3). All areas which contain fragments of natural forests or shrubs (cerrado) are protected and not part of the project area subject to afforestation. To conclude, none of the proposed project afforestation areas has been or will be cleared of native vegetation/ecosystems for planting activities. Of the total plantation area, 24 ha were planted on natural pastures. These are not included in the present carbon project.",
      "noDrainage": "Forestal Apepu does not drain soils as part of their planting preparation, as can be seen in chapter 1.11 - soil preparation. In summary, the project is eligible under the VCS requirements."
    },
    "projectDesign": "Forestal Apepu afforestation project corresponds to the VCS scope 14 (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) under the Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) AFOLU project category. The project is a grouped project and will register several different instances of project activities.",
